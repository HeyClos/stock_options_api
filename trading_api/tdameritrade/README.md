This is a very basic start to the accessing the TD Ameritrade API.  It was built specifically for my purposes. The python3 scripts do work, from the command line.

```python3 Option_chain_quotes.py cmg ``` will get you an option chain.

```python3  get_end_of_day_stocks.py``` will get you the closing price of stocks.

```python3 `stock_history_quotes.py``` will provide historical data of a particular stock

```python3 stock_movers.py``` will get a list of stocks on the move.

This is just a starting point, not the end. Pull requests accepted as well as issues.

However, bear in mind, I have a full time lousy job, working my own <a href="http://www.marketquants">trading algorithm</a>, a father of a four year old and a husband. :)
